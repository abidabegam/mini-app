# Mini HCM – React + Django Employee Management

This is a **Mini Employee Management Project** where I practiced connecting a **React frontend** with a **Django backend** using **REST APIs**.  
It supports **employee CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and **resume file uploads**.  
Through this project, I learned **API integration, file handling, and full‑stack workflow**.

##  Features

- **Employee CRUD**: Add, view, edit, and delete employees.  
- **Resume Upload**: Upload resumes as files for each employee.  
- **Search & Filter**: Quickly search employees by name or email.  
- **Admin Panel**: Manage data using Django Admin.  
- **Full-Stack Learning**: Integration of React (frontend) + Django (backend).
